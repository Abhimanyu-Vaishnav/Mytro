## 🚀 Performance Analysis

### Current Performance
- **Database Queries:** Some N+1 query issues
- **File Handling:** Basic optimization
- **Caching:** Not implemented
- **Static Files:** Basic serving

### Recommendations
1. Implement database query optimization
2. Add Redis caching
3. Use CDN for static files
4. Implement image compression
5. Add database indexing

---

## 🔒 Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```python
   # settings.py
   import os
   SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
   DEBUG = os.environ.get('DEBUG', 'False').lower() == 'true'
   ```

2. **Input Sanitization**
   ```javascript
   // Sanitize user input before DOM insertion
   function sanitizeHTML(str) {
       const div = document.createElement('div');
       div.textContent = str;
       return div.innerHTML;
   }
   ```

3. **CSRF Protection**
   ```python
   # Add to all AJAX endpoints
   from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_protect
   ```

4. **File Upload Security**
   ```python
   # Add file type validation
   ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif']
   MAX_FILE_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024  # 5MB
   ```
